Pandas - Most widely used Python libraries in data science.
           - The library has broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible
             open source data analysis and manipulation tool available in any language.

1. Creating Panda empty data-frames ( Like NumPy arrays - commonly used data structure)
            - First step in data munging ( munging ? - manipulating )
            - input to data-frames is served by differ data structure, ex. NumPy.




NumPy - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
             Features includes :
             -> a powerful N-dimensional array object
             -> sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
             -> tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
             -> Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
             -> Efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
             -> Seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
